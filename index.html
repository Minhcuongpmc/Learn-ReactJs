    <p>My name is Phan Minh Cuong</p>
    <p>My goal are to be able to speak English fluently for a year, to get a great job in the future and to make more money !</p>
    <p>I'm an IT student at Univerity, I have been learning English for ten years at school. But you know, I couldn't speak English,
        because, all I was taught are doing Grammar and Vocabulary tests. As I said, now I'm a student and studying at HN city, so, I have many opportunities to talk with foreigners who can speak
        English very well or native speakers.
